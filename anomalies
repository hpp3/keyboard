this file serves as a way for me to track the weird shit that happens

linxkb:
    this file implements ctrl-qwervorak
    in terminal:
        open:
            control shift still qwerty
            why is control being sent without me pressing it?
            c,v,a in chrome
            + in vim
            shift n opens new window
        fixed:
            ^a weird behaviour
            ^; is ^l
            ^c sends nothing
        not a bug:
            ^, sends , (normal behaviour)
            ^. sends . (normal behaviour)
    in chrome:
        a sends A
        c sends ^c
        v sends ^vv
